The main advantage of the tip-jet helicopter is the absence of heavy transmission and tail rotor, but if compared to conventional helicopters, it has significantly lower efficiency. The crucial parameter that impacts the performances of the tip-jet helicopter is a propulsion force at the end of the blade. The analytical and numerical calculations with results for prediction of this propulsion force are presented in this paper. The case study is the ATRO-X tip-jet helicopter. Its propulsion system is driven by the gas-generator Phoenix-100, as a power source, which generates propulsion force by ejecting the hot combustion products through the nozzles at the blades tips.}}

The second develops an assortment of methods to predict a number of descent characteristics of an airplane. The third introduces performance methods for sailplanes. Among others, this gives insight into the use of a sailplane flight polar for determining the speed-to-fly as well as circling flight in thermals.}
