    Nr   &    \textbf{ECSA Graduate Attribute (GA)}   &   \textbf{Activity addressing attribute}  &   \textbf{Reasoning} \\ \hline
    GA1 & \textbf{Problem-solving}  & 4.1.2,4.1.3,4.1.5 &  The planned activities mentioned all have clear objectives and obstacles that need to be overcome to achieve them. These will require creative solutions to achieve the objective. \\ \hline 
    GA2 & \textbf{Application of scientific and engineering knowledge} & 4.1.4, 4.1.5, 4.1.8 & These actives include creating a mathematical model of the system to then create a control system to be implemented. The building and design process will incorporate workshop trainings and learned from practicals  \\ \hline
    GA3 & E\textbf{ngineering design} & 4.1.1, 4.1.7 &   Each of these activities requires the student to create a solution to the problem by designing a part which will integrate into the system as a whole. \\ \hline
    GA4 & \textbf{Engineering methods, skills and tools, including Information Technology} & 4.1.2, 4.1.5, 4.1.6 & These activities all require skills gained throughout the Engineering course to be able to understand the system and to implement the appropriate solution. \\ \hline
    GA5 & \textbf{Professional and technical communication} & 4.1.11 & Professional report writing to explain the results and how the objectives were met will ensure all the student's information has been conveyed correctly. \\ \hline
    GA6 & \textbf{Individual, team and multi-disciplinary working} & 4.1.8, 4.1.10 & Throughout the build process, the student will need to work with technicians to help build the system. Effectively working with the technicians will ensure that the component will be created to the student's specification. The whole project will have the student's demonstrating their individual work. \\ \hline
    GA7 & \textbf{Independent learning ability} & 4.1.1, 4.1.2 &  As the student is a Mechatronic engineer, the more advanced fluid mechanics, such as rotor design, will require self work to research and understand how the rotor can be designed effectively. \\ \hline
