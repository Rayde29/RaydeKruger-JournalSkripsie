The main advantage of the tip-jet helicopter is the absence of heavy transmission and tail rotor, but if compared to conventional helicopters, it has significantly lower efficiency. The crucial parameter that impacts the performances of the tip-jet helicopter is a propulsion force at the end of the blade. The analytical and numerical calculations with results for prediction of this propulsion force are presented in this paper. The case study is the ATRO-X tip-jet helicopter. Its propulsion system is driven by the gas-generator Phoenix-100, as a power source, which generates propulsion force by ejecting the hot combustion products through the nozzles at the blades tips.}}
