\chapter*{Acknowledgements}
    I would like to say thank you to Dr. A. Gill for assisting me to develop this concept to propose as well as for his guidance throughout the project. The insight and encouragement provided was invaluable to this project. I would also like to thank the laboratory engineers and technicians especially as Mr.~K.~Neaves and Mr. F. Zietsman for their assistance while designing and for manufacturing the components of the proof of concept.
